# ðŸ“š CMT Conference Finder

## Project Description
While applying to conferences, it was difficult to find all opportunities because information was scattered across the web.  
While using Microsoft CMT, I discovered the "All Conferences" section, which listed multiple conferences at once.  
To make this list usable:

- I copied the full conference list into a text file.
- Used **pandas** to process and filter:
  - Only future conference dates.
  - Only **International conferences** and conferences held **in India**.
- Generated two outputs:
  - An **Excel file** (`Conference_data.xlsx`) for easy sorting.
  - An **HTML file** (`Hyperlinked_conferences.html`) with clickable conference links for direct access.

This project helps streamline the conference application process by organizing relevant events in a structured way.

## Future Enhancements ðŸš€

- **Dynamic Fetching**:  
  Replace the manual copy-paste of conferences with an automated scraper or an API-based system.

- **Host on GitHub Pages**:  
  Deploy the final clickable conference list (`Hyperlinked_conferences.html`) through GitHub Pages for public access.

- **Advanced Filtering Options**:  
  Filter by field (AI, Systems, Networking, etc.), submission deadlines, or conference format (virtual, hybrid, in-person).

- **Mobile-Friendly View**:  
  Improve HTML styling to make the conference list easier to browse on mobile devices.
